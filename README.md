# Homebrew-Formulae

Homebrew is known as "The missing package manager for macOS (or Linux)"

As a user, there is a lack of analytics to show the popularity of the packages installed by users using Homebrew which could vastly help users pick out the best packages for their needs. 
This project is based on that issue and contains python scripts that will grab data from a JSON API, parse out the information needed (using sleep to avoid slamming the server with multiple requests) and then sort out the data based on popularity using a custom key.
